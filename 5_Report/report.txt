### Report
The ATmega48PA/88PA/168PA/328P is a low-power CMOS 8-bit
microcontroller based on the AVR enhanced RISC architecture. By executing powerful
instructions in a single clock cycle, the ATmega328P achieves
throughputs approaching 1 MIPS per MHz allowing the system designer to optimize
power consumption versus processing speed The ATmega328P
provides the following features: 4K/8K bytes of In-System Programmable Flash with
Read-While-Write capabilities, 256/512/512/1K bytes EEPROM, 512/1K/1K/2K bytes
SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible
Timer/Counters with compare modes, internal and external interrupts, a serial
programmable USART, a byte-oriented 2-wire Serial Interface, an SPI serial port, a 6-
channel 10-bit ADC (8 channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), a programmable
Watchdog Timer with internal Oscillator, and five software selectable power saving
modes. The Idle mode stops the CPU while allowing the SRAM, Timer/Counters,
USART, 2-wire Serial Interface, SPI port, and interrupt system to continue functioning.
