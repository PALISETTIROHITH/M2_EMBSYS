### Applications


The primary applications for this project are for farmers and gardeners who do not
have enough time to water their crops/plants. It also covers those farmers who are
wasteful of water during irrigation.
As water supplies become scarce and polluted, there is a need to irrigate more
efficiently in order to minimize water use and chemical leaching. Recent advances in soil
water sensing make the commercial use of this technology possible to automate irrigation
management for vegetable production. However, research indicates that different sensors
types perform under all conditions with no negative impact on crop yields with
reductions in water use range as high as 70% compared to traditional practices.


1) Relatively simple to design and install.
2) It is safest system and no manpower is required.
3) The system helps to farmer or gardener to work when irrigation is taking place, as only the
 area between the plants are wet.
3) Reduce soil erosion and nutrient leaching.
4) The system need smaller water sources, as it consumes less than half of the water.
5) Fertilizers can also be provided by using the system.
6) PH content of the soil is maintained Through the suggestions which helps for healthy plant
 growth.
